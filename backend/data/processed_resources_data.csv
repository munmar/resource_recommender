First up in this course are Python and SQL. You’ll learn to distill messy, real-world datasets into analytical insights and create interactive data visualizations. Next, you’ll move beyond the “data” and into the “science” of data science. You will use scientific computing tools in Python, including NumPy, pandas, and SciPy to produce publication-quality, reproducible data reports. In this phase, students gain experience with artificial intelligence by using statistical models to make predictions about unseen data. Students start with inferential modeling via multiple linear regression and transformations of linear models. Next, they learn about object-oriented programming with scikit-learn, and then move on to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence theory, including concepts such as data leakage, overfitting, and regularization. Once students have a strong foundation in artificial intelligence from the previous phase, they are ready to move on to advanced AI models, deployment, and model interpretability. Some of the models have interfaces in scikit-learn similar to linear or logistic regression but more complex artificial intelligence algorithms underneath, such as k-nearest neighbors, random forests, clustering, and principal component analysis. Students also learn how to build artificial intelligence models for additional types of data, such as text data (also known as NLP or natural language processing). Further, students learn about the following two artificial intelligence models recommendation systems and deep learning with neural networks. To round out the phase, students learn how to quantitatively interpret model results and how to deploy artificial intelligence models with pipelines. The course finishes out with a capstone project.

Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster. You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set. To achieve top performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, Redis can persist your data either by periodically dumping the dataset to disk or by appending each command to a disk-based log. You can also disable persistence if you just need a feature-rich, networked, in-memory cache.

179,180,node.js,Introduction to Node.js,"Getting started guide to Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js is built on top of the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, and it's mainly used to create web servers - but it's not limited to just that. Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm. When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs. Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language. In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.",programming language,any,no,free,,https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/,getting started guide nodejs serverside javascript runtime environment nodejs built top google chrome v8 javascript engine mainly used create web server limited nodejs opensource crossplatform javascript runtime environment popular tool almost kind project nodejs run v8 javascript engine core google chrome outside browser allows nodejs performant nodejs app run single process without creating new thread every request nodejs provides set asynchronous io primitive standard library prevent javascript code blocking generally library nodejs written using nonblocking paradigm making blocking behavior exception rather norm nodejs performs io operation like reading network accessing database filesystem instead blocking thread wasting cpu cycle waiting nodejs resume operation response come back allows nodejs handle thousand concurrent connection single server without introducing burden managing thread concurrency could significant source bug nodejs unique advantage million frontend developer write javascript browser able write serverside code addition clientside code without need learn completely different language nodejs new ecmascript standard used without problem dont wait user update browser charge deciding ecmascript version use changing nodejs version also enable specific experimental feature running nodejs flag
