Students are required to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by completing prep. During prep, students will get accustomed to the Canvas platform, set up their computing environment and level set their knowledge of the basics of the programming languages that will prepare them for day 1. Students will learn how JavaScript works under the hood while gaining hands-on experience with JavaScript programming, interacting with the DOM, and event listeners. In addition, students will discover how AI models can help debug issues faster, as well as how to leverage AI chatbots through prompt engineering to clarify misconceptions. Students learn ReactJS, a component-based JavaScript framework, and have the opportunity to pick up key industry skills by building a project that interacts with an API. Students will also gain understanding of how AI tools can assist with code completion as well as generate unit tests for components. Students gain a thorough understanding of back end development basics, while learning a new language, Python. Next, students will get comfortable with object-oriented programming and storing information in databases using A1 SQL Builder and object relational mapping. Once students understand Python basics, they will learn to integrate AI features into their apps. Students learn Flask, a Python web framework, before using it to create their own JSON API along with scalable front ends with React, creating slick, functional, and interactive applications. After completing the four phases, each with their own group project, students work with instructors to come up with solo project concepts and spend dedicated time building a truly sophisticated application on their own. Students receive plenty of instructor feedback along the way, while diving deep into various advanced technologies needed to bring their concepts to life.

Students start with inferential modeling via multiple linear regression and transformations of linear models. Next, they learn about object-oriented programming with scikit-learn, and then move on to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence theory, including concepts such as data leakage, overfitting, and regularization. Once students have a strong foundation in artificial intelligence from the previous phase, they are ready to move on to advanced AI models, deployment, and model interpretability. Some of the models have interfaces in scikit-learn similar to linear or logistic regression but more complex artificial intelligence algorithms underneath, such as k-nearest neighbors, random forests, clustering, and principal component analysis. Students also learn how to build artificial intelligence models for additional types of data, such as text data (also known as NLP or natural language processing). Further, students learn about the following two artificial intelligence models recommendation systems and deep learning with neural networks.
